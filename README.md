# Viva Pinata Plus

Welcome to Viva Pinata Plus! Our mission is to enhance the classic gaming experience of *Viva Pinata* by addressing some of the limitations in the PC version and introducing modern quality-of-life features.

## Features

### 1. Disable Item Limits
One of the most requested improvements is the ability to bypass the item limits within your garden. Our mod eliminates these restrictions, allowing you to fully customize your garden without having to worry about running out of space for your favorite items.

## Installation

To get started with our mods:

1. **Download the Latest Release**: Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/viva-pinata-qol-mods/releases) section and download the latest version.
2. **Extract the Files**: Unzip the downloaded file to your *Viva Pinata* installation directory.
3. **Run the Launcher**: Start the Launcher.exe process before running Viva Pinata as usual.

## Security and Transparency

We understand that downloading and running mods can raise concerns about security. Please be aware:

- **Antivirus Alerts**: Your antivirus software might flag our mod files. This is a common occurrence with mods and other custom software. Rest assured, our files are safe and free from malware. 
- **Source Code Availability**: For complete transparency, the source code of our mods is available in this repository. You are welcome to review it, decompile the executable, or even compile it yourself to verify its integrity.
- **Antivirus Exclusion**: If your antivirus is flagging the launcher, you may need to add an exclusion. As more people do this, eventually Windows will catch on that the file is safe.

## Contributing
